# Why this exercice?
We value the integration of our developers within the team and the company, and we assess their soft skills during various hiring interviews. To validate your hard skills, we believe that using a coding exercise is the most effective method. While it may seem tedious and time-consuming to you, we are currently developing a Cloud solution to manage 1 billion IoT devices within the next 3 years. It is crucial for us to ensure that the thousands of components you conceive, discuss, and create fit together perfectly.

# What to do?
Implement all the required behaviors as described in the 'requests.http' file. This file contains the requests and their expected results.

# How return the result?
* Create a local git repository and commit all the initial files to it.
* Make iterative improvements and commit at each step or regularly.
* Zip the entire content and send it back via email to your contact.

# What is important?
Time is a constraint, but not an absolute one. We expect you to complete the entire exercise within a few hours. We will analyze your commits at various stages and assess the technical implementation. Therefore, pay attention to variable names and ensure code clarity. Remember, source code is written by and for humans, and computers come second. So, please write something readable.

If you find certain elements incomprehensible and are unable to complete them, you can skip them. We will review them together in the next technical interview.

# What is the next steps?
After reading and analyzing your solution, we will conduct a joint review session with you to discuss and improve your solution through live coding.

# FAQ
## Can I use Internet resources to find technical elements?
Yes, we don't expect that you know by heart every elements. 

## Can I use GitHub Copilot or equivalent tools?
No, while you may use such tools in your day-to-day work, we expect you to rely on your own skills to solve this problem.

## Can I ask someone else for help?
No, you should work on the exercise independently.

## Are comments important?
It is better to write readable code than long comments. If you have time to comment, you have time to improve code readability. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as documenting function contracts or when dealing with complex algorithms (e.g., matrix computations, compression algorithms, image dithering, etc.).

## Is pom correct?
Yes, please use Java17.
